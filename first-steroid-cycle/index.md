# FIRST STEROID CYCLE


So, you got interested in steroids :syringe: and are now trying to figure out where to start.

Beginners have one rule: KISS.

That stands for Keep It Simple, Stupid. The more chemicals you toss in at once, the bigger your chances of going down in a flaming fireball.

A big, bloated, gyno-y fireball. BUT most potential side effects can be avoided entirely if the cycle is followed correctly and the proper precautions are taken.

This post page will include how to administer the steroids, recommended doses and durations, how to prevent and counteract side effects, and what you can expect to gain from your first cycle.

{{< admonition tip "Tips for first steroid cycle" >}}
1.DO NOT GO FOR ORAL ONLY CYCLE.

2.GO FOR INJECTABLE TESTOSTERONE (300-500 MG PER WEEK)

3.ALWAYS HAVE PCT AND AI ON HAND.

4.CYCLE LENGTH SHOULD BE 12 TO 16 WEEKS.

5.DO BLOOD TEST BEFORE CYCLE.(IF POSSIBLE)

## DO NOT GO FOR ORAL ONLY CYCLE.

- Oral steroids are going to suppress your natural Testosterone production hard.

- All steroid cycles need to be taken together with a base of Testosterone to replace your natural production, which will be shut down.

- Without a Testosterone base, you will feel weak, tired, depressed, low libido, erectile dysfunction, muscle loss and weakness—all the symptoms of low testosterone.

## GO FOR INJECTABLE TESTOSTERONE (300-500 MG PER WEEK)

- 500 mg each week is recommended for your first cycle. You should at least inject every three days (E3D) or every 3.5 days (E3.5D) to keep blood levels as stable as possible for Testosterone Enanthate or Cypionate.

- 300 mg is a low dose. Gains are log-linear up to 600 mg and well beyond.

- There's little to no difference in sides between 300 and 500. There's no difference in shutdown between 300 and 500.

- Some low responders need as much as 200mg just to reach normal levels of Testosterone as addressed by TRT.

## 3.ALWAYS HAVE PCT AND AI ON HAND.

- After you did your 12-15 week cycle, you have to begin your Post Cycle Therapy (PCT).

- Every single individual will respond in a different manner to any chemical, compound, anabolic steroid, food or drug in existence.

- The main testosterone stimulating agents for HPTA recovery during PCT are:

1. Primary

SERMs (Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators)

2. Secondary:

hCG (Human Chorionic Gonadotropin)

Aromatase Inhibitors

## CYCLE LENGTH SHOULD BE 12 TO 16 WEEKS.

- You probably will start noticing enhanced recovery and mild weight gain around Weeks 3–4

- Testosterone E and C both take between 14-19 days to fully saturate, depending on your individual metabolism.

- Testosterone is a powerful tool, if used correctly and can put on a good +8-12 lbs of LEAN mass (excluding water and fat gain) over the course of 16 weeks.

- 10 weeks is slightly too little. 12 weeks is fine, You want to strike a balance between maximizing your gain and minimizing the time it will take to recover from the cycle

## DO BLOOD TEST BEFORE CYCLE(IF POSSIBLE)

- Regular blood work is STRONGLY encouraged. It is recommend getting blood work before starting your cycle (to assess your baseline Testosterone levels and general health), during your cycle (to confirm that your Testosterone is legitimate and properly dosed), and after your cycle (to assess how well you have recovered).

- The standard recommendation for Test E/C injections is to get bloodwork drawn 36-48 hours after your last injection

- CBC , Testosterone , Lipid profile , Liver Function , Kidney Function , Thyroid are some of important blood tests to be done.
