Beginners have one rule: KISS. That stands for Keep It Simple, Stupid. The more chemicals you toss in at once, the bigger your chances of going down in a flaming fireball. A big, bloated, gyno-y fireball. BUT most potential side effects can be avoided entirely if the cycle is followed correctly and the proper precautions are taken.

Oral steroids are going to suppress your natural Testosterone production hard. All steroid cycles need to be taken together with a base of Testosterone to replace your natural production, which will be shut down. Without a Testosterone base, you will feel weak, tired, depressed, low libido, erectile dysfunction, muscle loss and weaknessâ€”all the symptoms of low testosterone.

You should at least inject every three days (E3D) or every 3.5 days (E3.5D) to keep blood levels as stable as possible for Testosterone Enanthate or Cypionate. 300 mg is a low dose. Gains are log-linear up to 600 mg and well beyond. Thereâ€™s little to no difference in sides between 300 and 500. Thereâ€™s no difference in shutdown between 300 and 500. Some low responders need as much as 200mg just to reach normal levels of Testosterone as addressed by TRT.
